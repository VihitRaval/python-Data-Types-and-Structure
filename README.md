# 🐍 Python Data Types & Data Structures Assignment  

This repository contains my **Python assignment** that covers the fundamental concepts of **data types** and **data structures**.  
It includes both **theory-based questions** and **practical coding exercises** for better understanding.

## 📑 Contents  

### 1. Theoretical Questions  
- What are data structures, and why are they important?  
- Difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples.  
- Lists vs Tuples in Python.  
- How dictionaries store data.  
- Why use a set instead of a list.  
- Strings vs Lists in Python.  
- Tuples and data integrity.  
- Hash tables and dictionaries.  
- Lists with different data types.  
- Why strings are immutable.  
- Advantages of dictionaries over lists.  
- Use cases of tuples vs lists.  
- Sets and duplicate handling.  
- "in" keyword in lists vs dictionaries.  
- Mutability of tuples.  
- Nested dictionaries and use cases.  
- Time complexity of dictionary access.  
- When lists are preferred over dictionaries.  
- Why dictionaries are unordered.  
- Lists vs Dictionaries in terms of data retrieval.  

### 2. Practical Questions (with code)  
- String creation, slicing, and modifications.  
- List creation, appending, removing, accessing, reversing.  
- Tuple creation, accessing, searching, and validation.  
- Set creation, union, intersection, and element removal.  
- Dictionary creation, adding/removing keys, accessing values, merging.  
- Combined use of **lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries**.  
- Random number generation and sorting.
